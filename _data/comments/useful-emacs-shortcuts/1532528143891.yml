message: "Muscle memory should not be an excuse for sticking to an inferior key scheme. I've changed up my muscle memory multiple times, whether it was learning Dvorak, buying an Ergodox, then buying and sticking to a MacBook Pro... swapping Command and Control is a cakewalk in comparison.\r\n\r\nThe point is that you should not be using a suboptimal key for common editing operations. Caps Lock is automatically a no-go because it has no equivalent on the right side of the keyboard. Maybe you are just not a serious enough Emacs user for it to matter?"
