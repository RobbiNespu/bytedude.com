  As macOS user, I find it a no-go to switch Command to Control. The Command key
  is simply too engrained in muscle memory for everything else I do on my Mac. 
  Also, I don't see how hitting Control with your left pinky is any less awkward
  or straining than hitting Caps Lock. I find it worse, as the position is very
  cramped. With Caps Lock as Control, the pinky mostly rests there while my
  other fingers jump around completing the sequence.
