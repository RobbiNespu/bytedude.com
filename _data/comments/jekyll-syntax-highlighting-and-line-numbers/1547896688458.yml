message: "**Update:** I submitted a [PR to Rouge](https://github.com/jneen/rouge/pull/897) soon after this writing in order to get the `linewise` option supported by the syntax highlighter. If that PR gets accepted, I would submit another one to Jekyll to support `linedivs` natively, without the need for a plugin.\r\n\r\nWhile I'm still waiting for the PR to get merged (it's been almost a year!), it looks like it's been looked at by somebody -- finally!"
